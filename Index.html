        <p>The console screen is a screen for the programmer's reference. To print a variable on the console screen, you need to use the command console.log() and put the variable in the parentheses (()) Example: console.log(variable_example). If you want to print something that isn't a variable, you need to use the command console.log() and put what you want to put that isn't a variable within quotations ("") in parentheses (()) Example: console.log("example")
